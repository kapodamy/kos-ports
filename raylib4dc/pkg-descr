raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework 
and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical 
applications, embedded systems and education.

NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames 
programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just 
coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.
